1. `npm run start.watch` to start the Worker.
1. In another shell, `npm run workflow` to run the Workflow.
1. On your Discord application's Settings > OAuth2 > General (`https://discord.com/developers/applications/*/oauth2/general`), copy the ngrok URL logged by the workflow into a Redirects URL and save
